<p class=story>In February of 2015 Reshma and Rahul were looking for love the old fashion way, through an online dating site. Rahul sent a message to Reshma asking her thoughts on Serial, a podcast that was popular at the time and she responded. The two of them hit it off and began texting for a few weeks until Rahul finally convinced Reshma to meet in person. Reshma was reluctant as she spent the weekend before celebrating her sister's birthday and wasn’t in her best form. But Rahul insisted they meet that night so she went reluctantly to a very interesting first date. </p>

<p class=story>The first 30 minutes was silent and extremely awkward as they walked in the cold from bar to bar to try and find somewhere to sit. They finally found a spot and spent the entire night talking until the bar finally kicked them out. Over the coming months, they spent hours talking about life, music, dating, etc and grew closer and closer without even knowing what was happening. The rest was history...</p>

<p class=story>In November of 2017, After dating for over two and a half years, and knowing they were lucky and meant to be, Rahul decided to put a ring on it. He had been working really hard at his job and finally got the promotion he’d been waiting for. He was so elated that he went to his sister’s house to pick up the ring he had sent there, so he could propose later that week. On the train home, an anxiety riddled Rahul realized that he couldn’t wait any longer and he had to ask ASAP. </p>

<p class=story>Reshma rushed home to plan a few surprises to celebrate his big promotion, but little did she know he had a surprise as well. During all the excitement, Rahul couldn’t take it anymore and ran over to his backpack, pulled out the ring and got on one knee in front of their babies (11 goldfish). He made a speech about their entire relationship and how it had been based on happiness and instinct, and that he couldn’t wait a minute longer to be together forever. He then asked for her hand in marriage and she said yes!</p>

<p class=story>We’re excited to celebrate the next chapter of our union with you by our side!</p>
