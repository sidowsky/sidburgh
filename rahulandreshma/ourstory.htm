<p class=story>In February of 2015, Reshma and Rahul were looking for love the old fashion way, through an online dating site. Rahul sent a message to Reshma asking her thoughts on Serial, a podcast that was popular at the time and she responded with just the right amount of wit and humor. The two of them hit it off and began texting for a few weeks until Rahul finally convinced Reshma to meet in person. Their first date started off awkward as they tried to find a good bar to sit and talk, and ended with them chatting for the whole night until the bar finally kicked them out. </p>
<p class=story>Flash forward two years, Reshma and Rahul looked to their future and saw a mutual interest in traveling the world to experience different cultures, food, and people. They applied to a program called Remote Year, which would allow them to live in twelve different countries over twelve months, and to their excitement were accepted. Before they headed off on this once in a lifetime adventure, they wanted to recognize their relationship and commitment to each other by getting married in front of their family and friends.</p>
