<p class=story>So you’re going to attend an indian wedding…</p>
<br>

<h3 class=faq>What do I wear?</h3>
<p class=story>Guests are welcome to wear Western or Traditional Indian clothes. For the wedding, you’ll see a lot of the women wearing sari’s, salwar kameez or long dresses while men may be wearing a sherwani or a suit. </p>
<br>

<h3 class=faq>What shouldn’t I wear?</h3>
<p class=story>In the Indian culture, typically wearing head to toe white and black are not worn during auspicious times. This is because wearing white represents mourning and black represents darkness. (Don’t worry if your clothes have black or white on them). Other than that, wear bright colors to join the couple in their celebrations! </p>
<br>

<h3 class=faq>I heard Indian ceremonies are really long. How long will yours be?</h3>
<p class=story>Before the ceremony, Rahul and his family will make their way to the wedding hall in a grand fashion called the Baraat (see more on elephants below). Once the ceremony starts, it will last about an hour and lunch will be served shortly after. </p>
<br>

<h3 class=faq>What will the ceremony be like?</h3>
<p class=story>The ceremony will take place on the grounds of a Hindu Mandir (temple). A Hindu priest will officiate while numerous relatives perform specific roles under his guidance. The ceremony will involve Gujarati and Punjabi customs to blend each of Rahul and Reshma’s families cultures. More information will be available the day of in the wedding program. </p>
<br>

<h3 class=faq>What is the significance of henna or mehndi?</h3>
<p class=story>Reshma will put henna or mehndi on her hands and feet in preparation for her wedding day. It’s a common belief that the darker the color the mehndi leaves on the hands on a bride, the more will she be loved by Rahul.</p>
<br>

<h3 class=faq>OK, enough about the wedding. What about the food?</h3>
<p class=story>There will be Indian food at all of the wedding events. We promise it won’t be too spicy and that it will be delicious!</p>
<br>

<h3 class=faq>How do I address the elders at the event? </h3>
<p class=story>Aunty or uncle. Everyone older (think your parent’s age) is aunty or uncle. </p>
<br>

<h3 class=faq>Do I need to know a certain dance to celebrate?</h3>
<p class=story>No, but we highly recommend 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgFPNrD0OqQ">this</a>
 one. </p>
<br>

<h3 class=faq>What's this I hear about elephants?</h3>
<p class=story>Typically, the groom arrives at the wedding hall in a grand fashion with a dancing entourage and seated in a fancy car, on a horse, or even on an elephant. If anyone has an elephant, please call or text Rahul. </p>
