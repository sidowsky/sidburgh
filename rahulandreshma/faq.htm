<p class=story><i>So you&#39;re going to attend an indian wedding....</i></p>

<h3 class=faq>What do I wear?</h3>
<p class=story>Guests are welcome to wear western or traditional Indian clothes. For the wedding, you will see a lot of the women wearing sari&#39;s, salwar kameez, or long dresses while men may be wearing a sherwani or a suit. Feel free to wear bright colors and sparkly clothes!</p>
<h3 class=faq>What shouldn&#39;t I wear?</h3>
<p class=story>In the Indian culture, typically wearing head-to-toe white or black are not worn during auspicious times. This is because wearing white represents mourning and black represents darkness. (Don&#39;t worry if your clothes have black or white on them).</p> 


<h3 class=faq>I heard Indian ceremonies are really long. How long will yours be?</h3>
<p class=story>Before the ceremony, Rahul and his family and friends will make their way to the wedding hall in a grand fashion called the Baraat (see more on elephants below). Feel free to join in! Once the ceremony starts, it will last about an hour and lunch will be served shortly after.</p> 


<h3 class=faq>How do I address the elders at the event? </h3>
<p class=story>Aunty or uncle. Everyone older (think your parent&#39;s age) is aunty or uncle.</p>
<h3 class=faq>What will the ceremony be like?</h3>
<p class=story>The ceremony will take place on the grounds of a Hindu mandir (temple). A Hindu priest will officiate while numerous relatives perform specific roles under his guidance. The ceremony will involve Gujarati and Punjabi customs to blend each of the family cultures. More information will be available in the wedding program at the ceremony. </p>

<h3 class=faq>What is the significance of henna or mehndi?</h3>
<p class=story>Reshma will put henna or mehndi on her hands and feet in preparation for her wedding day. It&#39;s a common belief that the darker the color the mehndi leaves on the hands on a bride, the more will she be loved by the groom.</p>


<h3 class=faq>OK, enough about the wedding. What about the food?</h3>
<p class=story>There will be Indian food at all of the wedding events. We will have a range of spices for you to enjoy. </p>
<h3 class=faq>Do I need to know a certain dance to celebrate?</h3>
<p class=story>No, but we highly recommend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgFPNrD0OqQ">this</a> one. </p>

<h3 class=faq>What's this I hear about elephants?</h3>
<p class=story>Typically, the groom arrives at the wedding hall in a grand fashion with a dancing entourage and seated in a fancy car, on a horse, or even on an elephant. If anyone has an elephant, please call or text Rahul.</p>
